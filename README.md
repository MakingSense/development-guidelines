# Development Guidelines

This repository contains a set of documents explaining guidelines that we use in development. These are guidelines, not rules, and exceptions are allowed depending on what makes more sense for each project.

Feel free to take these guidelines and adapt them to your own organization / project. We also welcome feedback, so if something different has worked for you, let us know!

Please note that this repository focus on methodologies, processes and general human interaction. For code guidelines on different technologies, visit [code-style-guides](https://github.com/MakingSense/code-style-guides).
